    "Answer -\n",
    "As an expression, lambda returns a value that can optionally be assigned a name. \n",
    "In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, \n",
    "instead of returning is as a result. lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements"

    "Map operation takes a mapping function and a vector of data as arguments and returns a new vector, which is the result of applying the\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer -\n",
    "A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0)."
